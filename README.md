The EDIP is designed following a **microservices-oriented architecture** deployed on the Azure cloud. This approach promotes:

* **Modularity:** Breaking down the system into smaller, independent services.
* **Scalability:** Allowing individual services to be scaled based on demand.
* **Resilience:** Isolating failures to individual services.
* **Technology Diversity:** Enabling the use of the best technology for each service if needed (though .NET Core is standardized for backend services in this version).
* **Independent Deployment:** Allowing services to be developed, tested, and deployed independently.

Key architectural principles guiding the design include:

* **Cloud-Native:** Leveraging managed Azure services wherever possible.
* **API-First:** Designing all interactions between components and with external systems via well-defined APIs.
* **Event-Driven (where appropriate):** Utilizing message queues for decoupling and asynchronous processing (e.g., for document processing).
* **Security by Design:** Incorporating security considerations at every layer of the architecture.
* **Observability:** Implementing comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing.

* **Azure SQL Database:** The primary database for storing document metadata, audit trail information, user data, and system configuration.
* **Azure Blob Storage (Temporary Storage):** Used for temporary storage of documents during the processing pipeline before they are moved to OpenText CM.
* **Azure Blob Storage (Document Content):** While the primary storage is OpenText CM, Azure Blob Storage can be used as a staging area or for specific processing needs requiring direct file access. (Clarification: OpenText CM typically manages its own storage, but this can represent where CM stores the files, or a separate temporary/processing store).
* **Azure Cache for Redis:** Used for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., configuration settings, user permissions) to improve performance.
* **Azure Monitor/Application Insights:** Services for collecting telemetry, monitoring system health and performance, and providing logging and alerting.

**Detailed Data Flow:**

1.  A user uploads a document through the React frontend (A).
2.  The frontend sends the document to the API Gateway (C).
3.  The API Gateway routes the request to the Document Ingestion Service (D).
4.  The Ingestion Service validates the document and sends a message containing document details and a temporary storage location (or the document content itself for smaller files) to the Azure Service Bus Ingestion Queue (E).
5.  The Document Processing Service (F) consumes messages from the Ingestion Queue.
6.  For each message, the Processing Service retrieves the document content (if not included in the message) and initiates the classification process (G).
7.  If classification is required (Yes path), the Processing Service sends the document content (or a reference) to the ML Classification Service (H).
8.  The Classification Service processes the document using ML.NET models and returns the predicted document type and a confidence score (H).
9.  Based on the classification and confidence score, the Processing Service determines if metadata extraction is required (I).
10. If metadata extraction is required (Yes path), the Processing Service sends the document content (or a reference) and the classified type to the Metadata Extraction Service (J).
11. The Metadata Extraction Service extracts relevant fields and returns the extracted metadata (J).
12. The Document Processing Service (K) receives the extracted metadata (or proceeds without it if extraction was not required).
13. The Processing Service then prepares the document and metadata for storage in OpenText CM (L).
14. The Document Processing Service interacts with the OpenText CM Adapter Service (M) to store the document and its associated metadata in OpenText Content Manager (N).
15. Throughout the process, the Document Processing Service, Classification Service, Metadata Extraction Service, and OpenText CM Adapter Service record relevant information (classification results, extracted metadata, storage location) in the Azure SQL Database (P). An audit trail of the processing steps is also recorded (P).
16. The Document Search Service (Q) queries the Azure SQL Database (P) to retrieve document metadata and information about their location in OpenText CM (N).
17. When a user requests to view a document (R), the React frontend (B) calls the API Gateway (C), which routes the request to the Document Search Service (Q).
18. The Search Service retrieves the document's location from Azure SQL DB (P) and requests the document content from OpenText CM via the Adapter Service (M).
19. The OpenText CM Adapter Service retrieves the document from OpenText Content Manager (N) and returns it to the Search Service (Q), which then sends it back through the API Gateway (C) to the React frontend (B) for display (R).
20. Azure Blob Storage (S) is used for temporary storage during processing as needed (e.g., storing incoming files before they are sent to the Service Bus or OpenText CM).
21. All services log events and metrics to Azure Monitor/Application Insights (T) for monitoring and troubleshooting.

**3.3. Detailed Component Design**

This section provides more detailed insights into the design of key system components.

**3.3.1. Frontend Architecture**

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React.

* **Framework:** React
* **Language:** JavaScript (with TypeScript for improved maintainability and type safety)
* **State Management:** Context API or a state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand for managing global application state.
* **Routing:** React Router for navigation between different views.
* **Styling:** CSS Modules, styled-components, or a UI framework like Azure Fluent UI for consistent styling.
* **API Communication:** Axios or the native Fetch API for interacting with the backend API Gateway.
* **Component Design:** Follows a modular and component-based approach, with clear separation of concerns (container vs. presentational components).

**3.3.2. Backend Architecture**

The backend is composed of multiple microservices built using .NET Core.

* **Framework:** .NET Core
* **Language:** C#
* **Web Framework:** ASP.NET Core for building RESTful APIs.
* **Inter-service Communication:** Synchronous HTTP/REST calls for requests requiring immediate responses (e.g., user management) and asynchronous messaging via Azure Service Bus for document processing.
* **Database Interaction:** Entity Framework Core (EF Core) as the Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) for interacting with Azure SQL Database.
* **Security:** ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication and authorization, integrated with Azure AD.
* **Logging:** Structured logging using libraries like Serilog or NLog, integrated with Azure Monitor.

**3.3.3. Data Storage Architecture**

* **Metadata and System Data:** Azure SQL Database is used for storing structured data such as document metadata, user information, roles, permissions, configuration settings, and the audit trail. The schema is designed to be relational and optimized for querying and reporting.
* **Document Content:** OpenText Content Manager is the primary system of record for storing the actual document files. The EDIP interacts with OpenText CM via its API for storage and retrieval.
* **Caching:** Azure Cache for Redis is used as a distributed cache to store frequently accessed, non-sensitive data to reduce the load on the database and improve API response times.

**3.3.4. Machine Learning Integration Architecture**

* **Framework:** ML.NET is used for building and running the document classification models within the .NET Core ecosystem.
* **Model Training:** Model training is performed offline, potentially using Azure ML Workspace, and the trained models are then deployed with the ML Classification Service.
* **Integration:** The ML Classification Service exposes an internal API consumed by the Document Processing Service.
* **Model Management:** Future versions may include a mechanism for updating and managing ML models without requiring a full service redeployment.

**3.3.5. Integration Layer Architecture**

* **OpenText CM Integration:** The OpenText CM Adapter Service acts as a dedicated layer for all communication with OpenText Content Manager. This isolates the core processing logic from the specifics of the OpenText CM API, making it easier to update the integration or potentially integrate with other repositories in the future. The adapter handles authentication, document storage, retrieval, and metadata synchronization with OpenText CM.
* **Azure Service Integrations:** The system integrates with various Azure services (Service Bus, Blob Storage, SQL Database, Redis Cache, Monitor) using the respective Azure SDKs for .NET.

**3.5. Deployment Architecture**

The EDIP is deployed on Microsoft Azure.

* **Compute:** Initially, services will be deployed using Azure App Services for simplicity and ease of management. Future iterations may leverage Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for more complex orchestration and scaling needs.
* **Networking:** Azure Virtual Network (VNet) for secure communication between services. Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control traffic flow.
* **Database:** Azure SQL Database is deployed as a managed service.
* **Storage:** Azure Blob Storage is used for temporary processing needs. OpenText CM's storage is managed separately, potentially on Azure VMs or dedicated storage.
* **Identity Management:** Integration with Azure Active Directory for user authentication and authorization.

**4. Implementation Guide**

This section provides guidance for the development team on implementing the EDIP, focusing on key areas and providing code examples where illustrative.

**4.1. Development Environment Setup**

Developers will require the following installed and configured:

* .NET 6 SDK (or later)
* Node.js and npm/yarn
* A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code)
* Database tools for Azure SQL Database (e.g., Azure Data Studio, SQL Server Management Studio)
* Access to the Azure subscription and resource group for deployment and service configuration.
* Access to the OpenText Content Manager development environment.
* Version control system client (e.g., Git).

Project repositories will be hosted in Azure Repos or GitHub, with a standardized branching strategy (e.g., Gitflow).

**4.2. OpenText Integration Details**

The OpenText CM integration is handled by the dedicated `OpenText CM Adapter Service`. This service interacts with the OpenText Content Manager SDK or REST API.

**4.2.1. Connection and Authentication**

The adapter service will use configured credentials or authentication mechanisms provided by OpenText CM to establish a secure connection. This may involve username/password, certificates, or OAuth. Connection details should be stored securely, ideally in Azure Key Vault.

```csharp
// Example: Basic connection (Replace with actual OpenText CM SDK/API calls)
public class OpenTextService : IOpenTextService
{
    private readonly OpenTextClient _client; // Assume OpenTextClient is from their SDK
    private readonly ILogger<OpenTextService> _logger;

    public OpenTextService(IOptions<OpenTextSettings> settings, ILogger<OpenTextService> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
        // Initialize OpenTextClient with settings (e.g., URL, credentials)
        _client = new OpenTextClient(settings.Value.ApiUrl, settings.Value.Username, settings.Value.Password);
        _client.Connect(); // Establish connection
    }

    // ... methods for storing, retrieving, etc.
}

public class OpenTextSettings
{
    public string ApiUrl { get; set; }
    public string Username { get; set; }
    public string Password { get; set; } // Consider using Azure Key Vault
}
```

**4.2.2. Document Storage and Retrieval Implementation**

The `StoreDocument` method in the adapter service will handle uploading a document stream and its associated metadata to OpenText CM. The `RetrieveDocument` method will retrieve a document stream based on its identifier in CM.

```csharp
// Example: Store Document (Conceptual, actual implementation depends on OpenText CM SDK/API)
public async Task<string> StoreDocument(Stream fileStream, string fileName, Dictionary<string, string> metadata)
{
    try
    {
        // Use OpenText CM SDK/API to create a new document
        var documentId = await _client.CreateDocumentAsync(fileName, fileStream);

        // Add metadata to the document in CM
        await _client.AddMetadataAsync(documentId, metadata);

        _logger.LogInformation($"Document '{fileName}' stored in OpenText CM with ID '{documentId}'.");
        return documentId;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, $"Error storing document '{fileName}' in OpenText CM.");
        throw; // Re-throw or handle appropriately
    }
}

// Example: Retrieve Document (Conceptual)
public async Task<Stream> RetrieveDocument(string documentId)
{
    try
    {
        var fileStream = await _client.GetDocumentContentAsync(documentId);
        _logger.LogInformation($"Document content retrieved for CM ID '{documentId}'.");
        return fileStream;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        _logger.LogError(ex, $"Error retrieving document content for CM ID '{documentId}'.");
        throw;
    }
}
```

**4.2.3. Metadata Management**

The adapter service is responsible for mapping the EDIP's internal metadata representation to the metadata structure required by OpenText CM. This involves understanding the target OpenText CM record types and fields.

**4.2.4. Error Handling and Retry Mechanisms**

Robust error handling should be implemented for all interactions with OpenText CM. This includes handling connection errors, API errors, and data conflicts. Retry mechanisms (e.g., using Polly library in .NET) should be implemented for transient errors.

**4.3. .NET Core Backend Implementation**

Backend services are developed using .NET Core, following RESTful principles for APIs and leveraging asynchronous programming.

**4.3.1. API Design and Development**

APIs should be designed with clear endpoints, request/response models, and appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Input validation should be performed at the API layer.

```csharp
// Example: Document Upload Controller
[ApiController]
[Route("api/documents")]
public class DocumentsController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly IDocumentIngestionService _ingestionService;
    private readonly ILogger<DocumentsController> _logger;

    public DocumentsController(IDocumentIngestionService ingestionService, ILogger<DocumentsController> logger)
    {
        _ingestionService = ingestionService;
        _logger = logger;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    [Consumes("multipart/form-data")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> UploadDocument([FromForm] IFormFile file)
    {
        if (file == null || file.Length == 0)
        {
            return BadRequest("No file uploaded.");
        }

        if (file.Length > 500 * 1024 * 1024) // 500MB limit
        {
            return BadRequest("File size exceeds the limit of 500MB.");
        }

        try
        {
            using (var stream = file.OpenReadStream())
            {
                // Send document to ingestion service for processing
                await _ingestionService.IngestDocumentAsync(stream, file.FileName, User.Identity.Name);
            }

            return Ok(new { message = "Document upload initiated." });
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            _logger.LogError(ex, $"Error uploading document '{file.FileName}'.");
            return StatusCode(500, "An error occurred during document upload.");
        }
    }

    // ... other API endpoints (Search, Get Document, etc.)
}
```

**4.3.2. Business Logic Implementation**

Business logic should reside within dedicated service classes, separate from controllers, to ensure testability and maintainability.

**4.3.3. Data Access Layer**

Entity Framework Core is used to interact with Azure SQL Database. Repository pattern or direct `DbContext` usage can be employed. Asynchronous database operations should be used to avoid blocking.

**4.3.4. Security Implementation**

Implement authentication and authorization using ASP.NET Core features, integrating with Azure AD. Securely handle secrets and connection strings using Azure Key Vault. Implement input sanitization and protect against common web vulnerabilities.

**4.3.5. Logging and Monitoring**

Implement structured logging across all services using a consistent format. Configure logging to be sent to Azure Monitor/Application Insights for centralized collection, analysis, and alerting. Track key metrics related to request processing, errors, and external service calls.

**4.4. React Frontend Implementation**

The React frontend provides the user interface for interacting with the EDIP.

**4.4.1. Component Structure and Design**

Organize components logically into folders (e.g., `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `services`). Use a clear naming convention. Design reusable components.

**4.4.2. State Management**

Choose a state management strategy (Context API or a library) based on the complexity of the application state. Manage component-level state using `useState` and `useReducer` hooks.

**4.4.3. API Consumption and Data Display**

Use `axios` or `Workspace` to make HTTP requests to the backend API Gateway. Handle asynchronous operations and display loading and error states to the user.

```javascript
// Example: Document Upload Component
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function DocumentUpload() {
  const [selectedFile, setSelectedFile] = useState(null);
  const [uploadStatus, setUploadStatus] = useState('');

  const handleFileChange = (event) => {
    setSelectedFile(event.target.files[0]);
    setUploadStatus('');
  };

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (!selectedFile) {
      setUploadStatus('Please select a file first.');
      return;
    }

    setUploadStatus('Uploading...');
    const formData = new FormData();
    formData.append('file', selectedFile);

    try {
      const response = await axios.post('/api/documents', formData, {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data',
        },
      });
      setUploadStatus('Upload successful!');
      console.log('Upload response:', response.data);
      // Optionally clear selected file or update UI state
      setSelectedFile(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Upload error:', error);
      setUploadStatus(`Upload failed: ${error.message}`);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Upload Document</h2>
      <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
      <button onClick={handleUpload} disabled={!selectedFile || uploadStatus === 'Uploading...'}>
        Upload
      </button>
      {uploadStatus && <p>{uploadStatus}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default DocumentUpload;
```

**4.4.4. User Authentication and Authorization**

Implement login/logout functionality, integrating with the backend authentication endpoints. Manage user sessions and tokens securely. Implement logic to show/hide UI elements or restrict actions based on user roles and permissions received from the backend.

**4.4.5. Error Handling and User Feedback**

Implement centralized error handling to catch API errors and display informative messages to the user. Provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations (e.g., loading spinners).

**4.5. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration**

An automated CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps Pipelines (or a similar tool) is essential for efficient development and reliable deployments.

**4.5.1. Source Control Integration**

The pipeline should be triggered automatically by commits to specific branches in the source code repository (e.g., `develop` for development builds, `main` for production releases).

**4.5.2. Build Automation**

Configure pipeline jobs to build the .NET Core backend services and the React frontend application. This includes compiling code, restoring dependencies, and packaging build artifacts (e.g., Docker images for services, static files for the frontend).

**4.5.3. Automated Testing Integration**

Integrate automated unit tests, integration tests, and potentially performance tests into the pipeline. Builds should fail if tests do not pass. Code coverage analysis should be included.

**4.5.4. Deployment Automation**

Configure release pipelines to automatically deploy built artifacts to the appropriate Azure environments (Development, Staging, Production). This should include steps for:

* Provisioning or updating Azure resources (using Infrastructure as Code like ARM templates or Terraform).
* Deploying backend service containers/applications to Azure App Services or AKS.
* Deploying frontend static files to Azure Blob Storage or Azure CDN.
* Applying database schema changes.
* Updating application configuration (using Azure App Configuration or similar).

Deployment strategies like blue/green deployments or canary releases can be considered for production to minimize downtime and risk.

**4.5.5. Pipeline Monitoring and Alerting**

Configure the CI/CD pipeline to provide clear status updates and notifications on build and deployment success or failure. Set up alerts for pipeline failures.

**5. Testing Strategy**

This section outlines the comprehensive strategy for testing the EDIP to ensure it meets the specified requirements and quality standards.

**5.1. Overall Testing Approach**

The testing strategy for EDIP follows a multi-layered approach, including:

* **Unit Testing:** Focusing on individual code components.
* **Integration Testing:** Verifying interactions between different components and external systems.
* **Performance Testing:** Assessing the system's performance under various load conditions.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Validating that the system meets the end users' needs.
* **Security Testing:** Identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities.
* **Regression Testing:** Ensuring that new changes do not negatively impact existing functionality.

Testing will be integrated throughout the development lifecycle, with a strong emphasis on automation, particularly for unit and integration tests, as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

**5.2. Unit Testing**

Unit testing focuses on verifying the correctness of individual functions, methods, or classes in isolation.

**5.2.1. Scope and Objectives**

* To ensure that each unit of code performs as designed.
* To catch bugs early in the development cycle.
* To facilitate code refactoring by providing a safety net of tests.
* To serve as living documentation of the code's intended behavior.

**5.2.2. Tools and Frameworks (xUnit/Moq)**

* **Framework:** xUnit.NET is the chosen testing framework for .NET Core backend services due to its simplicity and extensibility.
* **Mocking:** Moq is used for creating mock objects to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies.
* **Assertion Library:** xUnit's built-in assertion methods.

**5.2.3. Test Case Design Principles**

* Tests should be independent and atomic.
* Each test should focus on a single piece of functionality.
* Tests should cover positive, negative, and edge cases.
* Tests should be repeatable and deterministic.
* Test names should be clear and descriptive.

```csharp
// Example: Unit Test for Document Classification Logic (using xUnit and Moq)
using Xunit;
using Moq;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using YourProject.Services; // Assuming your services are in this namespace
using YourProject.Models; // Assuming your models are here

public class DocumentClassifierTests
{
    private readonly Mock<IMLModelService> _mockMLModelService;
    private readonly DocumentClassifierService _sut; // System Under Test

    public DocumentClassifierTests()
    {
        _mockMLModelService = new Mock<IMLModelService>();
        _sut = new DocumentClassifierService(_mockMLModelService.Object);
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task ClassifyDocumentAsync_WithInvoiceContent_ReturnsFinanceCategory()
    {
        // Arrange
        var documentStream = new MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Invoice Number: INV-12345\nAmount: $1000"));
        var fileName = "invoice.pdf";

        // Configure the mock ML model service to return a specific classification result for this input
        _mockMLModelService.Setup(x => x.PredictDocumentTypeAsync(It.IsAny<Stream>()))
                           .ReturnsAsync(new ClassificationResult { DocumentType = "Finance", ConfidenceScore = 0.95 });

        // Act
        var classificationResult = await _sut.ClassifyDocumentAsync(documentStream, fileName);

        // Assert
        Assert.NotNull(classificationResult);
        Assert.Equal("Finance", classificationResult.DocumentType);
        Assert.True(classificationResult.ConfidenceScore >= 0.80); // Assuming the service applies the threshold
    }

    [Fact]
    public async Task ClassifyDocumentAsync_WithLowConfidence_FlagsForReview()
    {
        // Arrange
        var documentStream = new MemoryStream(System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Ambiguous text content..."));
        var fileName = "unknown.docx";

        // Configure the mock ML model service to return a low confidence score
        _mockMLModelService.Setup(x => x.PredictDocumentTypeAsync(It.IsAny<Stream>()))
                           .ReturnsAsync(new ClassificationResult { DocumentType = "Other", ConfidenceScore = 0.60 });

        // Act
        var classificationResult = await _sut.ClassifyDocumentAsync(documentStream, fileName);

        // Assert
        Assert.NotNull(classificationResult);
        Assert.Equal("Other", classificationResult.DocumentType);
        Assert.True(classificationResult.ConfidenceScore < 0.80);
        // Assert that the result indicates it needs review (assuming the service adds this flag)
        // Assert.True(classificationResult.RequiresReview);
    }

    // Add more test cases for different scenarios, file types, errors, etc.
}
```

**5.2.4. Test Execution and Reporting**

Unit tests will be executed automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline for every code commit. Test results will be reported in the pipeline, indicating pass/fail status and code coverage.

**5.3. Integration Testing**

Integration testing verifies the interactions between different components and external systems.

**5.3.1. Scope and Objectives**

* To ensure that different services and components work together correctly.
* To verify the integration with external systems like OpenText CM and Azure services.
* To test the data flow through the system.

**5.3.2. Testing of Component Interactions**

Test cases will focus on the interfaces and communication flows between services (e.g., testing the API Gateway routing to backend services, testing the Document Processing Service consuming messages from Service Bus and calling other services).

**5.3.3. Integration with External Systems (OpenText, Azure Services)**

Dedicated integration tests will verify the connectivity and correct interaction with OpenText CM (storing, retrieving documents) and relevant Azure services (SQL Database, Service Bus, Blob Storage). These tests may require access to dedicated integration environments.

**5.3.4. Test Environment Setup**

Integration tests require a dedicated environment where the integrated components and external systems are deployed and accessible. This environment should mimic the production environment as closely as possible in terms of configuration and connectivity.

**5.4. Performance Testing**

Performance testing assesses the system's responsiveness, throughput, and stability under various load conditions.

**5.4.1. Objectives and Metrics (Throughput, Latency, Resource Utilization)**
